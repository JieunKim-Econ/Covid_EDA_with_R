# Covid-19 EDA focused on visualization with R
This repository contains [the exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/JieunKim-Econ/Covid_EDA/blob/main/Risk-Resilience%20Matrix%20Analysis-C2.ipynb) of industry and consumption trends during Post-Covid era in South Korea. The analysis is based on the replication with [Data Science for Covid-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset) and my own independent extension. 

The purpose of our analysis is to visualize the economic shock of Covid-19 and ultimately to provide meaningful insights for industry forecast under the unprecedented pandemic era. Thus, it is important to look into not only the consumption trend in industry but the recovery speed of industry. To compute the impact in each industry, we introduce two indices as below.

* Risk Index: Indication of how "much" the consumption of one industry has changed in the *expansion* period
* Resilience Index: Indication of how "fast" the consumption of one industry has changed in the *stable* period

Lastly, with these two indices, we produce **Risk-Resilience matrix** that categorizes industry prospects into four types: *Silverlining, Immune, Resilient, and Vulnerable*.
